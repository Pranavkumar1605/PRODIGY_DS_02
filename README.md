# PRODIGY_DS_02
# Overview
In this project, I performed data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset. The goal was to understand the relationships between various factors, such as gender, passenger class, and age, with survival rates.

# Key Learnings

# Data Cleaning
      Handling Missing Values: Learned how to identify and fill missing values using techniques like median imputation for continuous variables and mode imputation for categorical variables.

      Dropping Irrelevant Columns: Removed columns with excessive missing data (e.g., the Cabin column) that would not contribute to the analysis.
# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
      Univariate Analysis: Explored individual variables, such as age and fare, to understand their distributions.
      
      Bivariate Analysis: Analyzed the relationships between two variables, such as survival rates by gender, passenger class, and age.
      
      Visualization: Used bar plots and histograms to visualize the data, making it easier to spot trends and patterns.

# Tools and Libraries Used

Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.

Matplotlib: For creating static visualizations.

Seaborn: For enhanced visualizations with better aesthetics.

Python: The primary programming language used for this analysis.
